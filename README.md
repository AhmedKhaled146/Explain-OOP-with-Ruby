<span style="color: #ffac4a; font-size: 40px;"> 1 - before OOP and OOP & Programming Paradigm </span> <br>

<span style="color: #dc8d00; font-size: 20px;"> Before you understand what OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is, you need to know what existed before it and the problems that led to the emergence of OOP. </span> <br> <br>

<span style="color: #dc8d00; font-size: 20px;"> Before OOP appeared, we used to write code almost on top of each other with no organization or structure. When I needed to modify the code, everything could break, and I might have to edit several parts of the code just for one small change. So, there was no organization or ease in making modifications. There were different ways of writing code called programming paradigms, including: </span> <br> <br>

<span style="color: #ffac08; font-size: 17px"> - Procedural programming paradigm </span> <br>
<span style="color: #ffac08; font-size: 17px;"> - Functional programming paradigm </span> <br> <br>

<span style="color: #f5e2bc; font-size: 20px;"> Each of these had its own advantages and disadvantages, which eventually led to the rise of OOP. Now, we need to understand what a programming paradigm is.</span> <br> <br>

<span style="color: #ff4c4c; font-size: 20px;"> Programming paradigm (Approach) is the Way or style you think in when building your software after gathering all the client’s requirements. The older programming paradigms were not suitable for every situation or business. This is where a new programming paradigm called OOP emerged, which stands for Object-Oriented Programming. </span> <br> <br>

<span style="color: #ff4c4c; font-size: 20px;"> OOP is a programming paradigm (Approach) that organizes software design around data, and objects, rather than functions and logic. It's "a Way for writing, organizing, and structuring code, not a standalone programming language." </span> <br><br>

<span style="color: #ff4c4c; font-size: 20px;"> Class: A class is the blueprint, model, standard entity, or a new data type I add to the language and use as I want. It has attributes and actions (methods). </span> <br> <br>

<span style="color: #ff4c4c; font-size: 20px;"> Object: An object is a copy of the class, inheriting the same attributes and methods from the class. It’s the actual thing that I use — "the real usage." </span> <br> <br>

<span style="color: #ff4c4c; font-size: 20px;"> Constructor: The constructor is the object-creation method, without which I cannot create an object. It's a special type of method that is automatically called when I create a new object. </span> <br> <br>
